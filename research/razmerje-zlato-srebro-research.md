## Executive Summary

The gold-silver ratio (GSR) measures how many ounces of silver equal one ounce of gold. It's a key tool for deciding WHEN to buy silver vs gold, and when to swap between them.

**Current ratio (Feb 2026):** ~62:1
**Historical average (20th century):** 47:1 to 60:1
**Modern average (last 50 years):** ~60:1

**The 80/50 Rule (verified by CBS News):**
- Ratio > 80:1 → BUY SILVER (silver is cheap)
- Ratio < 50:1 → BUY GOLD (gold is cheap)
- Ratio 50-80 → HOLD or buy both

## Historical Extremes (VERIFIED)

| Year | Ratio | Event | Source |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1980 | 15-17:1 | Silver mania peak | Investopedia, USAGOLD |
| 2011 | 32-35:1 | Silver peak ($49/oz) | SD Bullion, Investopedia |
| 2020 Mar | 100-125:1 | COVID panic | CBS News, GoldSilver |
| 2024 late | 80-85:1 | Pre-rally | CBS News |
| 2025 Dec | 64:1 | After silver rally | CBS News |
| 2026 Feb | 62:1 | Current | MetalPriceAPI |

**Key insight:** The ratio compressed from 80+ in late 2024 to ~62 now because silver OUTPERFORMED gold in 2025 (+150% vs gold's gains).

## The 80/50 Rule Explained (CBS News, Dec 24, 2025)

**What it is:**
- When ratio RISES ABOVE 80 → switch INTO silver (silver is undervalued)
- When ratio FALLS BELOW 50 → switch INTO gold (gold is undervalued)
- Between 50-80 → stay put, wait for extremes

**Why it works:**
The ratio tends to REVERT TO MEAN over time. Buying at extremes captures this reversion.

**Example:**
- Late 2024: Ratio at 80+ → "buy silver" signal
- Those who bought silver gained as ratio compressed to 64
- Silver more than doubled ($30 → $70+) in 2025

## Current Situation Analysis (Feb 2026)

**Ratio: 62:1**

At this level:
- ✅ Normal range — no extreme signal
- ✅ Slightly below modern average (60:1)
- ⚠️ Both metals can be held
- ⚠️ If ratio rises back above 80 → new silver opportunity
- ⚠️ If ratio drops below 50 → consider gold rotation

**Conclusion for Slovenian investors:**
Current ratio doesn't give strong buy/sell signal. Those who bought silver in late 2024 (ratio 80+) already captured the move. Now is time to HOLD and watch for next extreme.

## What Drives Ratio Changes?

1. **Economic fear** → Gold rises faster → ratio RISES
2. **Industrial boom** → Silver rises faster → ratio FALLS  
3. **Precious metals bull market** → Silver usually catches up → ratio FALLS
4. **Monetary crises** → Both rise, but silver often faster → ratio FALLS

**Key insight:** In bull markets for precious metals, silver typically OUTPERFORMS gold, compressing the ratio.
