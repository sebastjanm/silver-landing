## Executive Summary

This article exposes three key truths that bank financial advisors typically won't share with clients about precious metals:
1. **Conflict of Interest** - Advisors earn nothing from physical precious metals recommendations
2. **Physical vs Paper Gold** - The critical distinction between true ownership and counterparty risk
3. **Central Banks' Actions vs Advice** - Central banks are buying record amounts of gold while advisors steer clients away

## Key Research Findings

### 1. The Commission/Compensation Conflict

**Source: NBER Working Paper 17929 (Mullainathan, Noeth, Schoar - 2012)**
- Harvard/MIT study conducted audit of 284 financial advisors
- Key finding: "Advisers fail to de-bias their clients and often reinforce biases that are in their interests"
- Advisors encourage returns-chasing behavior and push for actively managed funds with higher fees
- Study cited in: AEA Web conference 2025, Morningstar, multiple academic papers

**Source: BullionStar US Blog (2025)**
- Mutual funds, annuities, insurance products: up to 6% commissions
- Physical precious metals: typically 1-3% margins, one-time transactions
- Fee-based advisors (1-1.5% AUM annually): physical gold stored outside financial system generates ZERO ongoing fees
- $100,000 allocated to physical gold = $1,000-1,500 lost annual revenue per client

**Source: Hero Bullion (2025)**
- Financial advisors paid two main ways: flat fee or commissions
- Commission-based advisors make nothing from physical precious metals
- Many companies explicitly instruct advisors not to discuss gold/silver
- Even flat-fee advisors often must follow company guidelines

**Source: True Gold Republic**
- "Assets Under Management (AUM) is the basis of their paycheck"
- Physical metals reduce AUM = reduces advisor income
- "You don't ask your barber if you need a haircut"

### 2. Lack of Expertise and Training

**Source: Multiple industry sources**
- Financial advisor curriculum focuses on stocks, bonds, mutual funds
- Physical precious metals rarely taught in financial planning programs
- Most advisors lack knowledge to properly advise on gold/silver
- CFTC warning: precious metals dealers often NOT licensed or registered to provide investment advice

**Source: CFTC Customer Advisory**
- "Unlike financial professionals who have a fiduciary responsibility to you, these dealers are not obliged to have your best interests in mind"
- Key distinction: licensed fiduciary advisors vs precious metals dealers

### 3. Physical Gold vs Paper Gold - Critical Distinctions

**Source: BullionStar / Morgan Stanley**
- Paper gold instruments: ETFs (GLD, IAU), mining stocks, futures, certificates
- All paper gold carries counterparty risk
- SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) prospectus: "The Trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its gold is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed"
- 2008 crisis: gold ETF holders surprised to learn their "gold investment" didn't guarantee access to actual metal
- 2020: spread between paper and physical gold prices temporarily widened to unprecedented levels

**Source: Morgan Stanley (2025)**
- "Unlike bonds and stocks, precious metals do not make interest or dividend payments"
- Physical precious metals = no SIPC protection
- Morgan Stanley recommends investors "independently evaluate" precious metals

### 4. What Central Banks Are Actually Doing

## Three Things Your Bank Advisor Will Never Tell You (Article Structure)

### Stvar #1: Ne zaslužijo na fizičnem zlatu in srebru
- Komisije: 0% za fizične kovine vs do 6% za vzajemne sklade
- AUM model: fizično zlato zmanjšuje njihovo osnovo za plačilo
- NBER študija: svetovalci krepijo predsodke, ki so v njihovem interesu
- Citat: "Svetovalci spodbujajo obnašanje lovljenja donosov in potiskajo aktivno upravljane sklade z višjimi provizijami"

### Stvar #2: Fizično zlato ≠ Papirno zlato
- ETF-ji nosijo tveganje nasprotne stranke
- GLD prospekt prizna: "Trust morda nima ustreznih virov za izterjavo, če je zlato izgubljeno"
- 2008 in 2020: razkorak med papirnimi in fizičnimi cenami
- Fizične kovine: brez tveganja nasprotne stranke

### Stvar #3: Centralne banke delajo ravno nasprotno
- 863 ton nakupov v 2025 (sami!)
- 43% centralnih bank načrtuje povečanje zalog
- Poljska: 550 ton, cilj 700 ton za "nacionalno varnost"
- Medtem vam svetovalci pravijo, da je "neproduktivna" naložba
