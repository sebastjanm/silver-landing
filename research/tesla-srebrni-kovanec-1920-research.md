# Research: Tesla in srebrni kovanec iz leta 1920

## Silver in EVs
- BEVs use 25-50g silver per vehicle (Silver Institute)
- Hybrid vehicles: 18-34g per vehicle
- Automotive sector could consume ~90 million ounces by 2025 (Silver Institute)
- Silver's high conductivity makes EVs more efficient - lightweight electrical connections
- Tesla Model Y = best-selling BEV in Europe H1 2025

## Industrial Silver Demand
- 2024: Industrial silver demand hit all-time high of 680.5 million ounces
- Solar panels: 197 million ounces in 2024 (~30% of industrial demand), tripled since 2015
- Key sectors growing: solar PV, EVs, AI/data centers
- No viable substitute for silver in these applications

## Silver Supply Deficit
- 2025: Fifth successive structural deficit, estimated at 95 Moz
- Cumulative deficit 2021-2025: ~820 million ounces
- Total demand 2024: 1.16 billion ounces
- Mine production expected to rise 2% to 835 Moz in 2025
- Supply growth flat while demand surges

## 1920s Silver Coins
- Peace Dollar (1921-1935): 90% silver, 0.77344 troy oz silver content
- Kraljevina SHS (Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, Slovenes) formed 1918 - first coins in 1920s
- Austrian 5 korona coins (1900-1909) common in region
- Yugoslav silver dinars minted from 1925 (10, 20, 50 dinar denominations)

## European EV Market
- Tesla Model Y = best-selling EV in Europe H1 2025
- BEV/PHEV registrations surging across Europe
- EU CO2 targets driving adoption
