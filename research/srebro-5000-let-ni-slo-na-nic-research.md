## Core Thesis

Physical silver has maintained value for 5,000 years without ever going to zero. This stands in stark contrast to:
- Fiat currencies (average lifespan 27 years)
- Stocks (countless bankruptcies)
- Bonds (sovereign defaults throughout history)
- Paper assets with counterparty risk

## Section 1: Silver's 5,000-Year History

### Ancient Origins

**Source:** World History Encyclopedia (worldhistory.org/Silver/)
- Silver used in Mesopotamia from 4th millennium BCE
- Imported from Anatolia, Armenia, Iran to Sumer and Babylon

**Source:** Wikipedia - Silver Standard
- Silver standard: monetary system from Sumerians c. 3000 BC until 1873
- More widespread than gold as monetary standard worldwide
- 4,873 years of silver-based monetary systems

**Source:** Gainesville Coins (history-of-silver)
- Silver first found in large amounts around 5000 BC
- Discovered during early copper mining
- Roman denarius introduced 211 BCE - 4.5 grams of 95% pure silver
- Roman denarius was "ancient world's reserve currency" for 500 years

### Key Historical Uses (World History Encyclopedia)
- Hacksilver for trade (rough-cut pieces)
- Store of wealth
- Jewelry, tableware, figurines
- Ritual objects

## Section 2: Fiat Currency Failures

### DollarDaze Study of 775 Fiat Currencies

**Source:** Business Insider, George Washington Blog, multiple references
- Study analyzed 775 fiat currencies throughout history
- **Average lifespan: 27 years**
- **No historical precedence for fiat currency holding value**

Breakdown of failures:
- 20% failed through hyperinflation
- 21% destroyed by war
- 12% destroyed by independence
- 24% monetarily reformed
- 23% still in circulation (facing one of above)

**Source:** Gini Foundation (ginifoundation.org)
- "Average lifespan of fiat currency is only about 35 years"
- Hyperinflation and currency collapses "happen much more frequently than many people realize"

### Worst Hyperinflation Cases

**Source:** Investopedia, CNBC, Nomad Capitalist, Economics Help

| Country | Year | Peak Inflation | Notable |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|
| Hungary | 1946 | 13,600,000,000,000,000% | Prices doubled every 15.6 hours |
| Zimbabwe | 2008 | 79,600,000,000% monthly | Printed $100 trillion banknote |
| Yugoslavia | 1994 | 313,000,000% monthly | 5 redenominations |
| Germany | 1923 | ~29,500% monthly | Weimar Republic collapse |
| Venezuela | 2018 | 1,700,000% | Still ongoing crisis |

**Zimbabwe example:**
- Loaf of bread cost 35 million Zimbabwe dollars
- Currency abandoned in 2009 in favor of foreign currencies

**Hungary example:**
- Worst case ever recorded
- 400 octillion pengő = 1 forint when new currency introduced

**Irreplaceable industrial applications:**
- Highest electrical conductivity of all metals
- Highest thermal conductivity
- Most reflective element
- Natural antibacterial properties

**2024 Industrial Demand:**
- Total electrical & electronics: 465.6 million ounces (record)
- Solar/photovoltaic: 197.6 million ounces (record)
- Limited substitution possible
- "Silver remains irreplaceable in many applications"

### Applications ensuring ongoing demand:
- Solar panels (growing 20%+ annually)
- Electric vehicles
- 5G networks
- Smartphones & electronics
- Medical devices (catheters, prosthetics)
- Water purification
- Brazing & soldering
- RFID chips
- 3D printing filaments

### No Counterparty Risk

**Source:** APMEX, Silver.com, Gainesville Coins
- Physical silver = direct ownership
- No reliance on third parties
- Cannot be printed or debased
- Cannot default
- "5,000-year history as store of value"

## Section 7: Central Banks Actions

### Record Gold Buying

- Diversification from US dollar
- No counterparty risk

**Actions > Words:** Central banks don't buy stocks, bonds, or fiat currency as reserves. They buy physical precious metals.

## Slovenian Context

**Source:** BSI (Bank of Slovenia)
