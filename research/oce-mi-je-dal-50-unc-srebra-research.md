### Intergenerational Wealth Transfer
- **Williams Group study (20 years, 3,200 families):**
  - 70% of wealthy families lose wealth by 2nd generation
  - 90% lose it by 3rd generation
  - Only 3% due to poor financial planning
  - 60% due to communication/trust breakdown
  - Source: AdvisorHub, Dunham, PWM, DataPoints

### Psychology of Physical Possession
- **Endowment Effect (Reb & Connolly, 2007):**
  - Physical possession creates subjective feelings of ownership
  - Effect not based on factual ownership but on feelings induced by touch/possession
  - Tangible objects valued higher than identical intangible ones
  - Source: Cambridge Core, Journal of Judgment and Decision Making

- **Peck & Shu research:** Merely touching an object increases perceived ownership
- **Physical silver as teaching tool:**
  - Tangible = understandable for children
  - Weight, shine = real experience vs abstract numbers
  - Creates "endowment effect" — child values it more because they hold it

### Financial Literacy Transfer
- **Lissington & Matthews (2012):** Children of financially literate parents are more likely to have robust financial skills (ResearchGate)
- **ScienceDirect (2024):** Positive intergenerational effect of financial literacy on children's opportunities
- **Empower:** "Giving while living" serves as educational tool, allows parents to model financial values

### Current Silver Market Context
- **5th consecutive supply deficit (Silver Institute)**
- **Cumulative deficit 2021-2025: ~820 million ounces**
- **2025 deficit: ~95 Moz**
- **Central banks bought 863t gold in 2025 (WGC)**
- **Poland CB: 550t gold (more than ECB's 506t)**
- **43% of CBs plan to increase gold holdings (record)**

### Slovenia Context
- **SURS:** 2025 annual inflation 2.7%, average 2.4%
- **BSI deposit rates:** Near zero for years
- **OECD:** Slovenia included in household wealth surveys
- **Proximity to Austrian Mint (Münze Österreich):** 1.5 hours from Ljubljana
