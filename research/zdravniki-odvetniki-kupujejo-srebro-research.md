### 6. Why Professionals Specifically?

**Key motivations for educated, high-income individuals:**
1. **Tax awareness** — understand compound erosion of purchasing power
2. **Risk understanding** — medical/legal training = analytical, evidence-based
3. **Privacy preference** — physical metals = no public record, no counterparty
4. **Estate planning** — intergenerational wealth transfer without bureaucracy
5. **Portfolio sophistication** — understand uncorrelated assets

**Why "quietly"?**
- Physical metals don't appear in brokerage statements
- No reporting requirements for physical possession (below certain thresholds)
- Cultural norm: wealthy don't discuss holdings publicly
- Goldman Sachs: gold is 2nd most popular black-swan hedge but <1% of portfolio = "insurance" approach
