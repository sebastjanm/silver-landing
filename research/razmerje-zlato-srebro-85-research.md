## SILVER MARKET FUNDAMENTALS

### Supply & Demand (Source: Silver Institute, World Silver Survey 2025)

**Supply (2024-2025):**
- Global mine production: ~819.7 million ounces (2024)
- Total supply (including recycling): ~813 Moz (2025)
- Recycling: 193.9 Moz in 2024 (12-year high, +6%)
- Production growth: ~1% annually (stagnant)

**Demand (2024-2025):**
- Total demand: ~1.16 billion ounces (2024)
- Industrial demand: Record 680.5 Moz (2024)
- Industrial demand share: Largest component
- Total demand 2025: Expected ~1.2 billion ounces

**FIFTH CONSECUTIVE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT:**
- 2025 deficit: ~95 million ounces (~10% of supply)
- Actual deficit (with ETP flows): ~300 million ounces
- Persistent deficits since 2020

### Industrial Demand Drivers:

**Solar Photovoltaics:**
- 2014: 11% of industrial silver demand
- 2024: **29% of industrial silver demand**
- 2023: 197 Moz demand (+77% y/y)
- 2024: 257 Moz demand (+31% y/y)
- 2026 projection: 120-125 Moz from solar alone
- 2030 projection: 546 Moz from PV (LBMA)

**Electric Vehicles:**
- EVs use 25-50 grams of silver per vehicle
- ICE vehicles: 18-34 grams
- EVs use 67-79% MORE silver than ICE
- EV demand to overtake ICE by 2027
- CAGR: 3.4% through 2031

**Data Centers & AI:**
- IT power capacity grew 5,252% from 2000-2025 (0.93 GW to ~50 GW)
- More computing = more silver-containing electronics

## INVESTMENT IMPLICATIONS

### Mean Reversion Theory:

The gold-silver ratio tends to revert to historical averages over time:
- When ratio > 80:1 → Silver considered undervalued
- When ratio < 50:1 → Gold may be better value
- Current ~57:1 is near "fair value" historically (40-60:1 range)

### Why Silver Can Outperform:

1. **Smaller Market:** Gold market is 6.5x larger by value
   - Small shifts in gold investor allocation = big silver price moves
   
2. **High Beta:** Silver typically moves 2-3x more than gold (both directions)
   - Highly correlated with gold but more volatile
   
3. **Industrial Demand Growth:** Unlike gold (mostly investment/jewelry), silver has growing industrial uses

4. **Supply Constraints:** Production stagnant while demand grows

### Expert Predictions:

- **CME Group:** Ratio likely to remain favorable for silver in 2026
- **USAGOLD:** Base case ratio of 70:1 by end of 2026
- **JP Morgan (Dec 2025):** Silver to average $56/oz in 2026
- **GoldBroker:** Possible consolidation period after 2025 surge

## ARTICLE ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED

**Original Title Claims "85:1 — zgodovinsko najvišje"**

This was likely accurate when content calendar was created but is now outdated. Current ratio is ~57:1.

**Options:**
1. Adjust title to current reality: "Razmerje zlato-srebro: Zakaj je padlo na 57:1 in kaj to pomeni za vaše prihranke"
2. Keep concept but frame as recent history: Explain ratio was 100+:1 in 2025, now at 57:1 = silver caught up
3. Focus on the opportunity: Even at 57:1, below historical peak = still time to diversify

**Recommendation:** Frame article around the gold-silver ratio as a tool for understanding relative value, use 2025's dramatic shift (100:1 → 57:1) as the hook, explain what it means going forward.
