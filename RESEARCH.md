## Understanding the Business

### What is Elementum?
- Slovenian company specializing in strategic precious metals investment
- Not a typical bullion dealer — offers a systematic investment approach
- Strong institutional references: NLB Bank, University of Ljubljana, Olympic Committee of Slovenia, National Museum, Firefighter Association
- Offers custom commemorative coins + investment products
- Key person: Peter Slapšak (Director)

### Sebastjan's Role
- Independent consultant helping individuals understand and use the Elementum 7* strategy
- Not employed by Elementum — works as guide/advisor
- Personal approach, one-on-one consultations

## The Elementum 7* Strategy Explained

### Star 1: Undervalued Real Values
- Gold/silver prices relative to stocks are as low as 1970 levels
- S&P 500 vs S&P GSCI commodity index ratio shows commodities are historically cheap
- **Message:** Now is ideal entry time

### Star 2: Buy More Gold WITH Silver (Ratio Strategy)
- Gold/Silver ratio fluctuates historically between 15:1 and 123:1
- Current ratio: ~78:1 (January 2026)
- Historical average: 40:1 to 50:1
- **Strategy:** 
  - When ratio is HIGH (like now): Buy SILVER
  - When ratio drops to ~40:1: SWITCH silver to gold
  - Result: More gold than if you bought gold directly
- **Example:** €10,000 at 78:1 ratio → buy silver → switch at 40:1 → end up with significantly more gold
- This is the "hidden yield" — growing holdings without additional investment

### Star 3: Dollar-Cost Averaging
- Buy at regular intervals with EQUAL AMOUNTS (not equal quantities)
- Smooths out price volatility
- Better long-term average price than lump-sum timing attempts

### Star 4: Better Prices Through Strategic Buying
- Storage in Swiss duty-free warehouse
- **No VAT** (22% savings in Slovenia!)
- Lower premiums above spot price
- Huge cost advantage vs buying locally with VAT

### Star 5: Five Investment Discounts
Tiered pricing based on total investment:
- €3,000 threshold
- €8,000 threshold  
- €25,000 threshold
- €50,000 threshold

Additional discounts:
- Loyalty discounts for returning customers
- Ambassador/referral discounts
- Switching discounts (when converting silver↔gold)

### Star 6: Elementum Ratio Strategy
- Active management of gold/silver ratio opportunities
- In last 60 years: 14+ optimal switching moments
- Historical precedent: Venetians and Portuguese used this strategy to build wealth

### Star 7: Tax-Free Employer Bonuses
- Slovenian law allows performance bonuses paid "in kind" (natura)
- Precious metals qualify as payment in kind
- Result: Lower income tax on bonus portion
- Employer benefit + employee benefit

## Target Audience Analysis

### Primary Target
- Slovenians aged 35-60
- Middle to upper-middle income
- Have savings but worried about:
  - Inflation eroding purchasing power
  - Low/zero bank interest rates
  - Stock market volatility
  - Pension system uncertainty
- Long-term thinkers (10-20 year horizon)
- Value security over speculation

### Secondary Target
- Parents saving for children's future
- Business owners diversifying assets

- Distrust of purely paper assets
- Value tangible, physical assets

- Want guidance, not sales pressure

---

## Psychology & Persuasion Angles

### Loss Aversion (Strongest Hook)
- "Vaši prihranki izgubljajo vrednost. Vsak dan."
- Show purchasing power decline chart (€100 in 2000 = €X today)
- Frame inaction as a choice with consequences

### Social Proof
- Elementum references (major institutions)
- Testimonials from regular people
- "X Slovenians already using this strategy"

### Authority
- Peter Slapšak expertise
- 20+ years of data backing the strategy
- Academic/institutional partnerships

### Scarcity (Opportunity-Based)
- Current gold/silver ratio is historically high
- "Window of opportunity" framing
- Not artificial scarcity — real market conditions

### Commitment & Consistency
- Start small (€50/month possible)
- Build habit of regular saving
- Small commitment → larger commitment over time

### Status Quo Bias (Address It)
- "Doing nothing is also a decision"
- Cost of inaction calculator
- Compare: €10k in bank vs €10k in silver over 10 years

## Common Objections to Address

### "Is this safe?"
→ Swiss storage, insured, Elementum track record, institutional clients

### "Is this a scam?"
→ Established company since [year], references from NLB, University, etc.

### "I don't understand precious metals"
→ Education-first approach, free consultation, simple explanations

### "I don't have enough money"
→ Start from €50/month, it's about consistency not amount

### "What if I need the money?"
→ Can sell anytime, liquid market, no lock-in period

### "What about VAT when I sell?"
→ Explain Swiss storage advantage, tax implications

### "Why not just buy gold directly?"
→ Ratio strategy explanation with calculator example

### "Why come to you instead of Elementum directly?"
→ Personal guidance, cut through complexity, help choose right approach for YOUR situation
